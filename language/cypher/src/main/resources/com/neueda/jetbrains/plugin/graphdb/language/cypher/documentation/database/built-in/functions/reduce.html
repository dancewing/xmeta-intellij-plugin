function <b>reduce</b>(accumulator = initial, variable IN list | expression)<br>
<br>
To run an expression against individual elements of a list, and store the result of the expression in an accumulator,
you can use reduce(). It will go through a list, run an expression on every element, storing the partial result in the accumulator.
It works like the fold or reduce method in functional languages such as Lisp and Scala.<br>
<br>
<b>Arguments:</b>
<div style="padding-left: 20px">
    accumulator: A variable that will hold the result and the partial results as the list is iterated<br>
    initial: An expression that runs once to give a starting value to the accumulator<br>
    list: An expression that returns a list<br>
    variable: The closure will have a variable introduced in its context. Here you decide which variable to use.<br>
    expression: This expression will run once per value in the list, and produces the result value.<br>
</div>
<br>
<b>Example Query:</b>
<pre>
    MATCH p=(a)-->(b)-->(c)
    WHERE a.name='Alice' AND b.name='Bob' AND c.name='Daniel'
    RETURN reduce(totalAge = 0, n IN nodes(p)| totalAge + n.age) AS reduction
</pre>
