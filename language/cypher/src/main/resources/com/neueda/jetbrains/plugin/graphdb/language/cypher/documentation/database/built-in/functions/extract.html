function <b>extract</b>(variable IN list | expression)<br>
<br>
To return a single property, or the value of a function from a list of nodes or relationships, you can use extract().
It will go through a list, run an expression on every element, and return the results in a list with these values.
It works like the map method in functional languages such as Lisp and Scala.<br>
<br>
<b>Arguments:</b>
<div style="padding-left: 20px">
    list: An expression that returns a list<br>
    variable: The closure will have a variable introduced in itâ€™s context. Here you decide which variable to use.<br>
    expression: This expression will run once per value in the list, and produces the result list.<br>
</div>
<br>
<b>Example Query:</b>
<pre>
    MATCH p=(a)-->(b)-->(c)
    WHERE a.name='Alice' AND b.name='Bob' AND c.name='Daniel'
    RETURN extract(n IN nodes(p)| n.age) AS extracted
</pre>
